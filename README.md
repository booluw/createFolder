# Create Folder
 Creates a VueJS starter modularity folder.

 By running `create-folder folderName` this creates a folder with `folderName` and some sub folders [services, interfaces, and store] with files with the folderName in .ts. It also creates a folderNameView.vue.
 This makes creating a folder[module] in a new Vue project a breeze.
